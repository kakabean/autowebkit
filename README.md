autowebkit
==========

a webkit to record and  orchestrate your actions and repeat it when you need.

This is a personal project created early in 2009, I noticed that there are many web applicatoins like twitter or bbs or other on line interactions, that need your always remember that next 10 minutes later, I need to do a click or some inputs in a special web page. The things catched us in mind, I have to open web and do a stupid click even if in the midnight just because that I want to be more stronger in the web game or more chance to get a wanted tickets. 

Its boring dirty worked, but the sponsers designed the rules we have to follow. 

So, This project is designed to provide a easy way for one if you are not a programer, you can draw your actions steps with web app and add some conditions if need, so that, just leave above boring things to autowebkit, it will help you to do the boring actions automaticly.
